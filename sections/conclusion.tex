\section{Conclusion}

\textcolor{red}{TODO:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduced GAN from game theory, information theory and optimal
  transport
\item it seems like GAN is just a refitting of optimal transport to a
  new problem.
\item Information theory helps us to develop a deeper intuition for
  what it is we are optimizing, i.e. we want to eliminate any extra
  uncertainty and surprise, and we want the generator and
  discriminator both to  ``know'' the true / empirical probability
  distribution of interest over the set of interest.
\item what else?
\end{enumerate}
