\section{Conclusion}

We
Introduced GAN from game theory, information theory and optimal
transport

it seems like GAN is just a refitting of optimal transport to a new
problem.

Information theory helps us to develop a deeper intuition for what it
is we are optimizing, i.e.\ we want to eliminate any extra uncertainty
and surprise, and we want the generator and discriminator both to
``know'' the true / empirical probability distribution of interest
over the set of interest.

what else?
